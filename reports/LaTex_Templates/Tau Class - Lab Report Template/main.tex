    \subsection{Concerns}
    
        You're right, Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) could be susceptible to immediate stock price swings. With a large portion of the ownership concentrated in insiders, public companies, and other institutional investors (holdings totaling 86.5\%) compared to mutual funds, the stock price could react more dramatically if these major investors decide to sell.  This concentration of ownership suggests that BEN might be a more stable choice for short-term investment strategies, but for long-term investors, the vulnerability to large investor sentiment should be a consideration

\section{Market Analysis}
    \subsection{Introduction to Market Analysis}
        This section will be focused on examining the Closing Price and Quarterly Revenue of Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20. We will discuss possible impacts to each respectively and then compare both together.
    
    \subsection{Closing Price}
        Below is the Closing Cost of Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) per month from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.
            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{images/CloseDataSet1mo.png}
                \caption{This chart represents the Closing Stock Price per Month from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.}
                \label{fig:figure}
            \end{figure}
        The price appears to be in a flux of plus or minus \$5.00 every quarter, a rate of change near 16.67\% of the stock value. In fact, if we look at the daily trades, we can see the jumps more clearly occur at a quartly period. 
            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{images/CloseDataSet1d.png}
                \caption{This chart represents the Closing Stock Price per Day from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.}
                \label{fig:figure}
            \end{figure}
        If we compare the two charts together, we can see the month average trails the daily report due to this large jumps in the Closing Price.
            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{images/CloseDataSet1dvs1mo.png}
                \caption{This chart represents the Closing Stock Price per Day vs. Closing Stock Price per Month from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.}
                \label{fig:figure}
            \end{figure}
        This leads us to comclude there is a market force acting on the start that makes it visiable for a daily trading over monthly trading. 

        Let us continue into the Quarterly Revenue reports.

    \subsubsection{Quarterly Revenue}
        Since Franklin Resources Inc. [NYSE:BEN] does have over \$1.6 trillion in asset under managerment, we can see their earnings report show a profit of sometimes breaking \$200 billion in recently quarter. Below is a chart show the recent Quarter Revenue from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.
            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{images/EarningByQt.png}
                \caption{This chart represents the report earning in Billions over the quarters from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.}
                \label{fig:figure}
            \end{figure}
        It appears that the revenue of Franklin Resources Inc. [NYSE:BEN] does fluxate plus or minus \$5 billion, coming to a rate of change near 2.5\%.  That means the stock value has a rate of change nearly 666.8\% higher than the rate of change of the revenue. 
            
    \subsubsection{Closing Price vs. Quarterly Revenue}   
        Let us now just simple compare the Closing Price of the stock to the Quarterly Revenue. We will do this by laying the Quarterly Revenue chart onto the Closing Price chart. Note that Y-axis for the right is the value of the stock and the Y-axis to the left is the Gross Revenue value in billions. The x-axis is the same for both.  
            \begin{figure}[H]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{images/CloseDataVsProfit.png}
                \caption{This chart compares the monthly and daily closing price against the reported quartly earning price (in red) 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.}
                \label{fig:figure}
            \end{figure}
        Now we can see that change in the stock value is inversely related to the reported revenue. What is causing this?

        Well in May 2023, the stock was rising due to the new of the merger, but the cost of the merger was impacting the profit at that time. Thus when the following revenue reports came out, investors paniced and the stock dropped. But after the merger, the company was becoming more profitable due to the completion of the merger, but investors still had not return to the stock. 
        It was not it the following earning report, did the investor come back. 
        As of the most recently quartly report, we see that the profit not being continuously positive, is having another negative impact on the stock value of Franklin Resources Inc. [NYSE:BEN]. This means, even one quartly report that is not exceed \$200 billion in revenue, will have a drastic impact on the stock price. 



\section{Conclusion}
    \subsubsection{Short Term}
       Franklin Resources Inc. [NYSE:BEN] is an active stock that has a ideal flux or rate of movement for day trading. Even through it does appear to be moving in a downward direction, it is still based upon a large profit companies. Thus, if the stock drops 5\%-10\% in an day, there is a good chance it will recover in a positive direction the following day or even within the same day of trading.

    \subsubsection{LongTerm}
        Not the most ideal for long term investments. Franklin Resources Inc. [NYSE:BEN] appears to rely heavily on acquisitions at the current time to remain profitable in the long term. Which is great, if the short-term investor did not effect value as dramatically as they do. Just looking at the most recent dating for the late two years, an investor barely broke even due to fluxation caused by the day trading community. 
        For that, a long term investment may over see a return of 2\% to 5\% beyond a 2 year time frame. For that reason, no long term investor should invest in Franklin Resources Inc. [NYSE:BEN] when other S\&P stocks have proven to be much more reliable over the long term.
