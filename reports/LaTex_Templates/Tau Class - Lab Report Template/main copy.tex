\section{History}
    Franklin Resources boasts a rich history dating back to 1947, when it began operations in the investment management field. The company initially focused on mutual funds, offering both fixed income and equity options (growth and value-oriented). Through strategic acquisitions, Franklin has continuously expanded its reach and expertise. Notable additions include:

    \subsection{Breakdown}

The pie chart below shows the distribution of ownership, were Insiders own the most at 40.88\% followed by Public Companies and Individual Investors at 25.85\%, Other Institional Investors at 19.77\% and finally Mutual Funds at 13.50\%.

        \label{fig:figure}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Concerns}
    
    You're right, Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) could be susceptible to immediate stock price swings. With a large portion of the ownership concentrated in insiders, public companies, and other institutional investors (holdings totaling 86.5\%) compared to mutual funds, the stock price could react more dramatically if these major investors decide to sell.  This concentration of ownership suggests that BEN might be a more stable choice for short-term investment strategies, but for long-term investors, the vulnerability to large investor sentiment should be a consideration

\section{Market Analysis}
    \subsection{Introduction to Market Analysis}
    This section will be focused on examining the Closing Price and Quarterly Revenue of Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20. We will discuss possible impacts to each respectively and then compare both together. 
    
    \subsection{Closing Price}
    Below is the Closing Cost of Franklin Resources Inc. (NYSE: BEN) per month from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.
        \begin{figure}[H]

            \includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{images/CloseDataSet1mo.png}
            \caption{This chart represents the Closing Stock Price per Month from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.}
            \label{fig:figure}
        \end{figure}
    The price appears to be in a flux of plus or minus \$5.00 every quarter. In fact, if we look at the daily trades, we can see the jumps more clearly occur at a quartly period. 
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{images/CloseDataSet1d.png}
            \caption{This chart represents the Closing Stock Price per Day from 2022-04-20 to 2024-04-20.}
            \label{fig:figure}
        \end{figure}
    If we compare the two charts together, we can see the month average trails the daily report due to this large jumps in the Closing Price.
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{images/CloseDataSet1dvs1mo.png}

            \label{fig:figure}
        \end{figure}
    This leads us to comclude there is a market force acting on the start that makes it visiable for a daily trading over monthly trading. 

    Let us continue into the Quarterly Revenue reports.

    \subsubsection{Quarterly Revenue}

        \subsubsection{Tables}
    
            The \verb*|\captionsetup[table]| command customizes the appearance of the captions for tables in the document. The \verb*|\tabletext{}| is used to add notes to tables easily. Table \ref{tab:table}, shows an example table.
            
            \begin{table}[H]
                \centering
                \caption{Small table example.}
    		\label{tab:table}
                \begin{tabular}{cc}
            	\toprule
                    \textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} \\
                    \midrule
                    Data 1 & Data 2 \\
                    Data 3 & Data 4 \\
                    \bottomrule
                \end{tabular}
                    
                \tabletext{Note: I'm a table text for additional information.}
                    
            \end{table}

    \subsection{Equation}
    
        Equation \ref{ec:equation} shows an example equation. 

	\begin{equation} \label{ec:equation}
            \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi + V(\mathbf{r})\Psi = -i\hbar \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t}
	\end{equation} 

        The \textbf{amssymb} package was not necessary to include, because the stix2 font incorporates mathematical symbols for writing quality equations. In case you choose another font, uncomment the package in \textit{tau class} code.

        If you want to change the values that adjust the spacing above and below in the equations, go to \textit{tau class-math packages} section and play with \verb|\setlength{\eqskip}{6.5pt}| value until the preferred spacing is set. See appendix for more information.

\section{Environment}

    The \textit{tau class} includes custom environments designed to enhance the presentation of information within documents. Among these custom environments are \textbf{tauenv}, \textbf{info} and \textbf{note}.

    \begin{tauenv}[frametitle=Custom title]
        This is an example of the custom title environment. To add a title type \verb|[frametitle=Custom title]| next to the beginning of the environment (as shown in this example).
    \end{tauenv}

    One of the main features of the info and note environment is that they automatically change the language of their titles (currently English and Spanish).

\section{Coding}

    \textit{Tau class} includes the \textit{listings} package, which offers versatile and customizable features for typesetting code snippets in \LaTeX\ documents. Specifically for C, C++, \LaTeX\ and Matlab codes. 

    For C and C++ codes, the \textit{listings} package recognizes the syntax of these programming languages and highlights keywords, comments, and string literals accordingly.

    \lstinputlisting[caption=Example of C code., language=C]{example.c}

    Similarly, for Matlab codes, the \textit{listings} package offers syntax highlighting and line numbering, to the MATLAB language syntax.
    
    \lstinputlisting[caption=Example of matlab code., language=Matlab]{example.m}

\section{References}

    The default formatting for references follows the IEEE style. This style is commonly used for technical documents, research papers, and scholarly articles in engineering fields \cite{einstein}.

    At the end of the document, you will find an example of the default reference formatting \cite{dirac}.
